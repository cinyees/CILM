      <h1>You relentlessly dictate the group's direction.</h1>
      <font color="#8C2F25"> Your groupmates start to change your ideas nonetheless, but do it without consulting you.
        They are in frequent contact with each other, and change the direction of the group project. When it comes to presentation day,
        the group have been forced to use your presentation structure, but utilise the freedom you have given them with their content to
        redirect the message of the presentation. This results in a disastrously incoherent presentation, leaving the audience slightly confused
        with the sentiment they are supposed to be left with.

          <b> Personal sentiment </b> <br>
        In most group projects, it is inevitable that the urge to override your teammates' suggestions arises because they do not align with your vision.
        However, it is imperative to find a middle ground - each member thinks that their ideas are just as viable as you think yours are, and therefore
        see value in their own contributions. Throughout the module, and prior to the group presentation, I realised through the cohort's revelations
        that your academic and cultural background affected the way that you thought about certain topics, each culture having their own idea about
        what was conservative, what was controversial and morality. This was important to the final presentations - with each of the group mates coming
        from different places, individual contributions to the work were particularly important to understand how to address the topic of environmental disasters in a way that was both
        informative, yet culturally sensitive and empathetic.
