      Congratulations! All the hours invested into this module throughout the year has paid off - while this reflective piece was not a large proportion of the assessed work,
      this is a personal victory to you - you took the gamble and reaped the awards. You feel that you have come out the other end with a set of supportive skills that will underlie
      your approach to future academic practices, and situations you will encounter in the work space. <b> You have won the game of CILM! </b>

        <b> Personal Sentiment <br> </b>
      Upon hearing that the maximum word count was 1000, it is tempting to sit down for one session and write an essay for the last time. However, I knew that writing an essay
      to express my reflections would not do the complexity of my experience with the module justice. I knew that I needed to create something that was as difficult to progress through as the
      module was for me, and I wanted to evoke the same feelings by making the marker go through the same choices. This could not be done by simply expressing my own thoughts in writing - whilst
      empathy of the reader may enable them to understand to an extent, I did not think that this would make the same impact. Further, the summation of the module as an essay would not reflect the
      abstractness of the module. Whilst the process was arduous, this was reflective of my experience with the module - arduous and complex, yet strangely rewarding. The skills gained were not
      something you would specifically summon in any specific tasks, but ones that would be the foundation of any approach to future projects. <b> Forcing yourself
        to be uncomfortable in unfamiliar situations to transform those circumstances into ones that would be comfortable, critically approaching seemingly substantiated information, learning new
        ways of presenting and communicating, mindfulness and reflection throughout processes one might coast through, questioning your information, and last but not least, using your best efforts to enhance your own learning experience.
        Personally, the most important thing for me to realise was that <i> what you get is what you make. </i>
