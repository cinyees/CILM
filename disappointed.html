        you get back into the hustle and grind of writing extensive essays. You appreciate the ease back into the traditional academic methods you anticipate for
        the rest of your time at university. However... </font>

          Writing an essay is familiar to you, and straightforward. You have just finished a long essay, and are in the mindset to complete another one. You can duly express your thoughts without worrying that your message won't be received.
          Any other mediums will have to be explained anyway, and the marker may not receive your approach the way you want them to. The risk of using a different medium
          to express how you felt throughout the module will be risky...
          <br>
          <br>
        However, you have a seedling of an idea. Why not give yourself one last challenge? You have recently picked up the skill of basic coding through an extra-curricular, learning how to code your own website and add components to it.
        How about presenting the journey through the module as a series of choices to be encountered? That way, you can almost make the marker take the module, presenting them with the same choices and thoughts
        that you were faced with. What better way to put the marker in your shoes? However, it will still be risky: you have no one to ask for help if your code fails you....
