        will be a better approach, easing the group dynamics, getting the project over with. Even though you don't think that
        your group will do too well in this assessment, you decide to go with your plan to compensate for whatever grade you get with
        the other individual assignments.

          <b> Personal Sentiment </b> <br>
          Whilst in group projects there is always a temptation to gain a free ride, especially if you observe that one of
          your group mates is already doing this, and that there is no peer assessment for this project. However, to get an unsatisfactory
          grade knowing that you could have brought it up is a dubious work ethic. From past group projects, I learned that it is better
          to put in your best effort despite the behaviour of other group mates - at the end of the day, it is your own grade that you are
          sacrificing just for temporary ease. Additionally, I realise that such situations are bound to arise in many work situations -
          it is inevitable that there will be group work with people you are unfamiliar with, and that similar learning experiences at university will
          help me to understand the most efficient way to work and compromise with your groupmates.

        Whilst one of our group members was absent, and another seriously ill, the rest of the group performed to the best of our abilities.
        Though some of our group members were unsatisfied with the mark, I thought it was reflective of what we could achieve with the limiting circumstances.
        I believed that there was no unfairness in this, but that these were circumstances that arise in real life, and we did what we could do.
